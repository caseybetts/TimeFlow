## Core Features:

- Task Input: Allow users to input tasks with start times, durations, and task types. Buffer windows will be inferred from task type.
- Visual Timeline: Visually display the schedule in a clear timeline format, showing tasks and their buffer windows.
- AI Task Optimizer: Suggest optimal task order using an AI tool, if a user is running behind, based on task types and remaining time windows, focusing on minimizing conflicts.
- Task Categorization: Categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, errands) using colors for quick identification on the timeline.
- Local Storage: Store schedule data in the user's local storage.
- Edit and Reschedule: Ability to edit and reschedule tasks directly within the timeline.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498DB) to promote organization and focus.
- Background color: Very light blue (#ECF0F1), almost white, providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Emerald green (#2ECC71) to highlight completed tasks and positive confirmations.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for its clean, neutral, and modern appearance, suitable for on-screen reading.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent task categories (e.g., briefcase for work, calendar for appointments).
- Timeline layout should be clean and intuitive, using visual cues to represent time blocks and buffer zones clearly.
- Subtle animations on task completion and rescheduling to provide positive feedback and a sense of progress.
